      "prehensive) look at the historical timeline of how quantum mechanics came about. The\n",
      "actual history is of course never as clean as an outline like this suggests, but we can at least\n",
      "get a general idea of how things proceeded.\n",
      "1900 (PLANCK): Max Planck proposed that light with frequency v is emitted in quantized\n",
      "lumps of energy that come in integral multiples of the quantity,\n",
      "E = hv = hw\n",
      "(1)\n",
      "where h ~ 6.63 . 10-34 J . s is Planck's constant, and h = h/2T = 1.06 . 10-34 J . s.\n",
      "The frequency v of light is generally very large (on the order of 1015 s-1 for the visible\n",
      "spectrum), but the smallness of h wins out, so the hv unit of energy is very small (at least on\n",
      "an everyday energy scale). The energy is therefore essentially continuous for most purposes.\n",
      "However, a puzzle in late 19th-century physics was the blackbody radiation problem. In a\n",
      "nutshell, the issue was that the classical (continuous) theory of light predicted that certain\n",
      "objects would radiate an infinite amount of energy, which of course can't be correct. Planck's\n",
      "hypothesis of quantized radiation not only got rid of the problem of the infinity, but also\n",
      "correctly predicted the shape of the power curve as a function of temperature.\n",
      "The results that we derived for electromagnetic waves in Chapter 8 are still true. In\n",
      "particular, the energy flux is given by the Poynting vector in Eq. 8.47. And E = pc for\n",
      "a light. Planck's hypothesis simply adds the information of how many lumps of energy a\n",
      "wave contains. Although strictly speaking, Planck initially thought that the quantization\n",
      "was only a function of the emission process and not inherent to the light itself.\n",
      "1905 (EINSTEIN): Albert Einstein stated that the quantization was in fact inherent to the\n",
      "light, and that the lumps can be interpreted as particles, which we now call \"photons.\" This\n",
      "proposal was a result of his work on the photoelectric effect, which deals with the absorption\n",
      "of light and the emission of elections from a material.\n",
      "We know from Chapter 8 that E = pc for a light wave. (This relation also follows from\n",
      "Einstein's 1905 work on relativity, where he showed that E = pc for any massless particle,\n",

      "that were known.\n",
      "1924 (DE BROGLIE): Louis de Broglie proposed that all particles are associated with waves,\n",
      "where the frequency and wavenumber of the wave are given by the same relations we found\n",
      "above for photons, namely E = hw and p = hk. The larger E and p are, the larger w\n",
      "and k are. Even for small E and p that are typical of a photon, w and k are very large\n",
      "because h is so small. So any everyday-sized particle with large (in comparison) energy and\n",
      "momentum values will have extremely large w and k values. This (among other reasons)\n",
      "makes it virtually impossible to observe the wave nature of macroscopic amounts of matter.\n",
      "This proposal (that E = hw and p = hk also hold for massive particles) was a big step,\n",
      "because many things that are true for photons are not true for massive (and nonrelativistic)\n",
      "particles. For example, E = pc (and hence w = ck) holds only for massless particles (we'll\n",
      "see below how w and k are related for massive particles). But the proposal was a reasonable\n",
      "one to try. And it turned out to be correct, in view of the fact that the resulting predictions\n",
      "agree with experiments.\n",
      "The fact that any particle has a wave associated with it leads to the so-called wave-\n",
      "particle duality. Are things particles, or waves, or both? Well, it depends what you're doing\n",
      "with them. Sometimes things behave like waves, sometimes they behave like particles. A\n",
      "vaguely true statement is that things behave like waves until a measurement takes place,\n",
      "at which point they behave like particles. However, approximately one million things are\n",
      "left unaddressed in that sentence. The wave-particle duality is one of the things that few\n",

      "1925 (HEISENBERG): Werner Heisenberg formulated a version of quantum mechanics that\n",
      "made use of matrix mechanics. We won't deal with this matrix formulation (it's rather\n",
      "difficult), but instead with the following wave formulation due to Schrodinger (this is a\n",
      "waves book, after all).\n",
      "1926 (SCHRODINGER): Erwin Schrodinger formulated a version of quantum mechanics that\n",
      "was based on waves. He wrote down a wave equation (the so-called Schrodinger equation)\n",
      "that governs how the waves evolve in space and time. We'll deal with this equation in depth\n",
      "below. Even though the equation is correct, the correct interpretation of what the wave\n",
      "actually meant was still missing. Initially Schrodinger thought (incorrectly) that the wave\n",
      "represented the charge density.\n",

      "plitude. By \"amplitude\" we mean that the wave must be squared to obtain the desired\n",
